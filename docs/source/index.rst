Space Invaders
==============

In ECE 3710, we will be focusing on a specific project that will allow us to apply the concepts and techniques learned throughout the course: programming the classic arcade game Space Invaders on an embedded system.

Space Invaders is an iconic game that was first introduced in the late 1970s and has since become a staple of gaming culture. It is a game that challenges players to defend the Earth from invading aliens, using a laser cannon to shoot down wave after wave of enemy ships.

Our goal for this project is to design and implement Space Invaders on an embedded system, such as a microcontroller, using modern development tools and programming techniques. This will involve designing the game logic, graphics, sound, and input interfaces, as well as optimizing the code for performance and efficiency.

Through this project, we will gain practical experience in embedded systems design and programming, as well as develop our problem-solving and teamwork skills. By the end of the project, we will have a fully functional Space Invaders game that can be played on an embedded system, demonstrating our mastery of the course material and our ability to create complex systems from scratch.
