Software Installation
=====================

.. _installation:

There are two software packages that you will need in order to develop code for the C8051F020 boards. The first is the Silicon Labs IDE (IDE stands for "Integrated Development Environment"). This code is no longer openly supported by Silicon Labs but it can be found if you have the right link. The link below should get you where you need to be:

The second software package you will need is Keil PK51. This package contains the tool chain (i.e. the compiler, assembler and linker) that you will need to translate your source code into a program the C8051F020 understands.

Both of these software packages are available at the following link:
