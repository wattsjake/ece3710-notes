Debugging with an Silicon Labs IDE
==========================================================

.. _debugging:

IMPORTANT: One of the most common sources of trouble that 
students encounter comes from poor file organization. Create a 
folder that will contain each of the labs and projects we will do this 
semester; then, when a lab or project is assigned, create a new 
folder in that master folder to hold all of the code for that project. 
Feel free to copy from previous labs or projects but never update 
code that works for an earlier lab or project so that it will work with 
the current one. You must always be able to back out to an earlier 
lab and have confidence that it will still work.
