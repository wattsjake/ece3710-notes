Introduction
############

.. _introduction:

Released in 1978 by Taito, Space invaders was one of the earliest “shooting”
video games. The goal is to defeat waves of alien invaders that zig-zag towards
Earth with a laser cannon, and of course, to score as many points as possible
doing it. The invaders have lasers too and they shoot them, more or less at
random, at the laser cannon and the shields that have been deployed for the
player’s defense. If the invaders reach Earth, the player loses. If the laser cannon
is destroyed (either by laser fire or by contact), the aliens regroup and attack the
next laser cannon. If all the aliens are destroyed, the player must face a new
wave of aliens that starts closer and moves faster.

For this project, we use the LCD to display the laser cannon, the aliens and the
score. Shields are optional. One pushbutton is used to start the game and the
other is used to fire the laser cannon. The position of the laser cannon is
controlled by a potentiometer mounted near the display. Game parameters are
configured with a DIP switch.


Scope
=====

.. _scope:

This section specifies the scope of the document. The scope tells the reader what the
document covers, and more important, what it doesn’t cover. 

Design Overview
===============

.. _design_overview:

This section should include the following:
 2.1. Requirements.
In this section, enumerate the requirements of the design. Most of this
information will be provided to you by your client (the person asking you to do
the design).
 2.2. Dependencies.
In this section, enumerate the things that your design depends on, for
example a 5 volt power source.
 2.3. Theory of operation.
In this section, give a high-level overview of the design. Briefly describe each
functional block and how they work together.
 2.4. Design Alternatives (if applicable).
Briefly describe other approaches to the design and for each explain why that
approach was not taken.
